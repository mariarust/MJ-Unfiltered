                <p><strong>Hi! I'm Maria Rust</strong>, a sophomore at Miami University majoring in sports media and communications with a minor in marketing. I’m originally from Milford, Ohio, and I’m so excited to share my story with you!</p>
                <p>I come from a unique background—I'm a triplet! I have two amazing twin brothers who are both in the Navy, and my parents also met while serving in the Navy. Being part of a military family has shaped a lot of who I am today, and I’m proud of my roots. I’m also half Filipino, which is something I cherish deeply about my identity.</p>

                <p>Growing up, I was always active. I played lacrosse throughout high school and loved being involved in team sports. It taught me the value of teamwork, dedication, and perseverance. It also gave me lifelong friendships that I treasure!</p>
                <p>At home, I have two adorable German Shepherds, Elle and Bo. Elle is two and a half years old, and Bo is one and a half. They’re my little sidekicks, and we love spending time outdoors. Whether it's playing in the yard or going on hikes, they’re always there to keep me company. You’ll see a lot of them on this blog because they definitely make life more fun!</p>

                <img src="/MJ Unfiltered /Images/christmasfriends.jpg" alt="Maria with friends during Christmas" class="styled-img">
                <p>I’m passionate about sports, media, and communication. Growing up, I was always surrounded by sports, and I knew early on that I wanted to combine my love for storytelling with my interest in sports. Through my major at Miami, I’m gaining the skills I need to create compelling content and share the excitement of the games I love!</p>
                <p>Whether it’s through social media, marketing, or writing, I’m determined to make an impact in the world of sports media. But, beyond the sports world, I’m just someone who loves life. I enjoy traveling, trying new foods, and spending time with family and friends.</p>
